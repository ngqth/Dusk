# Dusk Dwm

This is a fork of [Dusk](https://github.com/bakkeby/dusk/) which is also a fork of [Suckless dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/)

[Bakkeby](https://github.com/bakkeby) is also the owner of the famous [dwm-flexipatch](https://github.com/bakkeby/dwm-flexipatch). Please check him out.

This build is built mainly to use with my own key-bindings driven by [sxhkd](https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd)
